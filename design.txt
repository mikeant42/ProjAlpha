you get to play as mage or mage-killer
- in the game mages are seen as as quite op. when mages attack a mob all surrounding npcs will also attack. this
will not happen to the mage killer, but mages are more powerful.
- the endgame boss will require both a mage and a mage-killer, as he will have different "modes" where
he either cannot be attacked by magic or physical attack

the mage path will begin with the player realizing how op he is. The "watcher" will greet the mage, as the main villian
of the story.
- the first scene of the mage path will begin by letting the watcher gift the mage unlimited mana and letting him test his powers against a
low-level mob(this will not happen again!!)
- the mage then goes on a character arc that takes him to find the mages who sell mana, and he discovers that it is literally "blood of the world",
something that drains the life of the planet when used.
- mana is acquired from underground drilling, it is found within the inner core of the planet
