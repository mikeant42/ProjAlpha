turn based, 2d, top down
- tick based

open map / world
- in-game player trading
- medieval setting with fantasy elements

combat progression
- players can unlock new spells by finding scrolls, or finding npc's that will teach you
- each scroll acts as a "card" with a certain requirement to cast.
- you can get them by killing monsters
  - thinking of a system where you can collect "essence" from pvp combat and you can use these to form "new" spells



tech
- full inventory system
- full npc system
- full combat card system
    - it will probably go like `damage = gear * spell` and `hit = spell accuracy * gear accuracy`
    - it will give players each 8 seconds to select a card


player progression
- players can unlock new armour by killing or buying

questing
- don't know if i'm gonna implement quests
